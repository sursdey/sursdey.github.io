									<p>It was not my first time attending a yoga session! But strangely, <span>after attending the retreat session with Sursdey Yoga I have learned something different.</span> I found that yoga is beyond exercise; it is more about well-ness, breathing, and keeping the mind focused. If you are a beginner like me, a session from Sursdey yoga is highly recommended.</p>
